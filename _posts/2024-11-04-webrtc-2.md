## Concepts
The `device1` and `device2` must exchange their ***location info*** to make a  `Peer` connection. 

## Basic things with WebBrowser
Example with WebBrowser from [Hussein Nasser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FExZvpVvYxA) with this [git repo](https://github.com/hnasr/javascript_playground/tree/master/webrtc) will show us how to deal with WebRTC with super basic knowledge demostration!

### PeerA or Device1 setup 
***Recommened*** to copy & paste each line to see what will happend.
```javascript 
// This is a using RTCPeerConnection
const localConnection = new RTCPeerConnection()
 
// Connect RTC with local, to create new `ICE CANDIDATE`
localConnection.onicecandidate = e =>  {
console.log(" NEW ice candidate!! on localconnection reprinting SDP " )
 console.log(JSON.stringify(localConnection.localDescription))
}

// This is setup on DataChannel if, 
// `Message Comming` -> `onmessage` will be use
// `Another Peer Connected` -> `onopen` will be use
// `Aessage Peer Disconnected` -> `onclose` will be use
const sendChannel = localConnection.createDataChannel("sendChannel");
sendChannel.onmessage =e =>  console.log("messsage received!!!"  + e.data );
sendChannel.onopen = e => console.log("open!!!!");
sendChannel.onclose =e => console.log("closed!!!!!!");

// Lastly this action will create an `OFFER`
localConnection.createOffer().then(o => localConnection.setLocalDescription(o) )
```

The `OFFER` results might more than 1 (for me, I got 5 OFFERs)

Copied `OFFER` that we got, to be use in next step.

### PeerB or Device2 setup & connection


``` javascript
// Set the OFFER that we got on PeerA or Device1's tab
const offer = PEER_A_OFFER

const remoteConnection = new RTCPeerConnection()

remoteConnection.onicecandidate = e =>  {
console.log(" NEW ice candidnat!! on localconnection reprinting SDP " )
console.log(JSON.stringify(remoteConnection.localDescription) )
}

 
remoteConnection.ondatachannel= e => {

  const receiveChannel = e.channel;
  receiveChannel.onmessage =e =>  console.log("messsage received!!!"  + e.data )
  receiveChannel.onopen = e => console.log("open!!!!");
  receiveChannel.onclose =e => console.log("closed!!!!!!");
  remoteConnection.channel = receiveChannel;

}


remoteConnection.setRemoteDescription(offer).then(a=>console.log("done"))

//create answer
await remoteConnection.createAnswer().then(a => remoteConnection.setLocalDescription(a)).then(a=>
console.log(JSON.stringify(remoteConnection.localDescription)))
//send the anser to the client 
```

### Setup PeerA with `ANSWER` from PeerB

```javascript
const answer = PEER_B_ANSWER

localConnection.setRemoteDescription (answer).then(a=>console.log("done"))
```

then both browser will connected directly!!

#### Both peer has connected with datachanel
`PeerA` send a message to `PeerB`

`PeerB` send a message to `PeerA`

> In this part we manually act as `Sinaling Server` to deliver `OFFER`, `ANSWER` to `PeerA` and `PeerB`.
{: .prompt-tip }
> With `Sinaling Server` setup, it is crucial to understand how peer exchange their credential(`OFFER`, `ANSWER`).
